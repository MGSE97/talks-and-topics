# Talks and Topics

Source codes and documentation for my talks and topics.

## Talks

Talks are in form of presentations or workshops, that were planned to be presented before some audience. They will contain some information on how to run them, what to look for.

## Topics

Topics are focused on some part of technology, and are basically demos with comments. They might be used for talks in the future. They will contain some information on how to run them, what to look for. But they might not be documented or contain some presentation flow to look for.
